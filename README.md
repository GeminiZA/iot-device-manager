## Setup

### Server Setup

#### Locally

- clone the repository
- create `.env` see [example](.env.example) in root directory of the repository
- run `go build .`
- run `./iot-device-manager`

#### Docker-Compose

- clone the repository
- create `.env` see [example](.env.example) in root directory of the repository
  - The following should be omitted and rather specified the in `docker-compose` command for the docker setup:
  - MQTT_BROKER_PORT
  - MQTT_BROKER_WS_PORT
  - API_PORT
- run `docker-compose up -d` or `MQTT_BROKER_PORT=1883 MQTT_BROKER_WD_PORT=8000 API_PORT=8080 docker-compose up -d` (defaults) to specify the ports to be used
- run `docker logs iot-device-manager` to ensure everything is started correctly

### Standalone Mochi Setup

- Create `config.yaml` in `startMochi/`
- Add users needed for devices and server
- run docker-compose up -d
- will always restart on unexpected shutdown

#### config.yaml

The specified ports in listeners should match the ports provided in the environment variables set for the iot-device-manager

```
listeners:
  - type: "tcp"
    id: "mqtt"
    address: ":1883"
  - type: "ws"
    id: "mqtt-ws"
    address: ":8000"

hooks:
  auth:
    ledger:
      auth:
        - username: "[username]"
          password: "[password]"
          allow: true
        - username: "[username]"
          password: "[password]"
          allow: true
```

# Usage

## Devices

Devices are references by `id` which is a `uint` and need to be added to the server by the http endpoint before the server will keep track of it's status and telemetry

## MQTT

All assets updates should be published to `assets/:id`

MQTT username and password must match that defined in `mochi-mqtt/config.yaml`

update messages are _json_ and of the following form:

```
{
  "status": string,
  "telemetry": object
}
```

Status is a string to allow extension on it's functionality

Telemetry is a json object to allow any sort of data to stored in it regardless of what device needs to publish

## HTTP

### Endpoints

#### GET (/assets/:id)

Returns the asset details including as _json_:

- Name
- Status
- Telemetry

```
{
  "name": string,
  "status": string,
  "telemetry": object
}
```

#### POST (/assets)

Creates a new device and subscribed to the relevant MQTT topic

Request body:

```
{
  "name": string,
  "id": int
}
```

id must be a _positive 32 bit integer_ and must be unique

Returns as _json_:

- Name
- ID

```
{
  "name": string,
  "id": int
}
```

Notes:

The id should ideally be generated by the server to ensure no conflicts then returned to the device, the id is required in the request body to adhere to the middleware requirement in the provided requirements

#### PUT (/assets/:id)

Updates the details of the device and publishes the update the the relevant MQTT topic

Request body:

```
{
  "status": string,
  "telemetry": object
}
```

`telemetry` is a _json object_ as to allow any data to be stored

Returns only a status code

#### DELETE (/assets/:id)

Deletes the device from the database and subsequently disallows updates to that device from the MQTT broker

No Request Body

Returns only a status code
